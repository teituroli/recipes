## Method

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente, reserving 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. While pasta cooks, cut the guanciale into small lardons and cook in a cold pan over medium heat until the fat renders and the pieces are golden and crisp. Remove from heat.

3. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and finely grated pecorino. Add a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper.

4. Add the drained pasta to the pan with the guanciale (off the heat). Quickly pour in the egg mixture, tossing vigorously and adding pasta water a splash at a time to create a glossy, creamy sauce that coats every strand.

5. Serve immediately, topped with more pecorino and black pepper.

> **Tip:** Never add the egg mixture over direct heat — the residual warmth of the pasta is enough. This is what separates carbonara from scrambled eggs pasta.
