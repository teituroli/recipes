## Marinade

1. Cut chicken thighs into chunks. Mix with yogurt, half the garlic and ginger (minced), 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp cumin, turmeric, chili powder, and salt. Marinate at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the fridge.

2. Grill or broil the chicken at high heat until lightly charred on the outside. Set aside.

## Sauce

3. Melt butter in a large pan. Add diced onions and cook until deeply golden — about 15 minutes. Don't rush this step.

4. Add remaining garlic and ginger. Cook 2 minutes until fragrant.

5. Add remaining spices and cook 1 minute. Add canned tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes until the sauce thickens and the oil separates.

6. Blend the sauce until smooth (optional but recommended). Return to the pan.

7. Add the grilled chicken and cream. Simmer 10 minutes. Adjust seasoning.

8. Serve with basmati rice or naan, topped with fresh coriander.
