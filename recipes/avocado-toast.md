## Method

1. Toast the sourdough slices until deeply golden and crunchy.

2. Halve the avocado, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Add lemon juice, salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Mash with a fork — leave it a little chunky.

3. Spread generously onto toast. Top with chili flakes and a final drizzle of olive oil.

4. **Optional:** Serve with a poached or fried egg on top for extra staying power.

> **Variations:** Add sliced radishes, everything bagel seasoning, smoked salmon, or crumbled feta.
